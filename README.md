## üìú Abstract

While previous multimodal slow-thinking methods have demonstrated remarkable success in single-image understanding scenarios, their effectiveness becomes fundamentally constrained when extended to more complex multi-image comprehension tasks. This limitation stems from their predominant reliance on text-based intermediate reasoning processes. While for human, when engaging in sophisticated multi-image analysis, they typically perform two complementary cognitive operations: (1) continuous cross-image visual comparison through region-of-interest matching, and (2) dynamic memorization of critical visual concepts throughout the reasoning chain. Motivated by these observations, we propose the Complex Multi-Modal Chain-of-Thought (CMMCoT) framework, a multi-step reasoning framework that mimics human-like "slow thinking" for multi-image understanding. Our approach incorporates two key innovations: (1) The construction of interleaved multimodal multi-step reasoning chains, which utilize critical visual region tokens, extracted from intermediate reasoning steps, as supervisory signals. This mechanism not only facilitates comprehensive cross-modal understanding but also enhances model interpretability. (2) The introduction of a test-time memory augmentation module that expands the model's reasoning capacity during inference while preserving parameter efficiency. Furthermore, to facilitate research in this direction, we have curated a novel multi-image slow-thinking dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Complex Multi-Modal Chain-of-Thought (CMMCoT):** A multi-step reasoning framework designed for complex multi-image understanding tasks.
*   **Interleaved Multimodal Reasoning:** Constructs reasoning chains incorporating critical visual region tokens as supervisory signals for better cross-modal understanding and interpretability.
*   **Test-Time Memory Augmentation:** Enhances the model's reasoning capacity during inference without increasing parameter count.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zhangguanghao523/CMMCoT.git
    cd CMMCoT
    ```
2.  Create and activate a conda environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    conda create -n cmmcot python=3.11
    conda activate cmmcot
    ```
3.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üöÄ Training


**Data Format:**

The training data should follow this JSON format:

```json
{
  "id": "birds-to-words-0",
  "image": [
    "oss://mvap-public-data/VQA/Mantis-Instruct/birds-to-words/train_images/1724336.jpg",
    "oss://mvap-public-data/VQA/Mantis-Instruct/birds-to-words/train_images/6741766.jpg"
  ],
  "conversations": [
    {
      "from": "human",
      "value": "What are the differences in coloring and physical features between animal1 and animal2 in the bird images?<image> <image>"
    },
    {
      "from": "gpt",
      "value": "animal2 <|box_start|>(412,356),(623,701)<|box_end|><IMG>1</IMG><image> has more vivid coloring, particularly with the yellow on the chest and the red on the head. animal1 <|box_start|>(298,245),(512,847)<|box_end|><IMG>0</IMG><image> has more white coloration and appears to have a longer and sharper beak."
    }
  ]
}
```



The training process consists of two stages:

**Training Stages:**

1.  **Stage 1:** Run the first stage of supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
    ```bash
    bash scripts/train/mdl/sft_full_streaming_7b.sh
    ```
 

2.  **Stage 2:** Run the second stage of SFT (with different datasets/settings).
    ```bash
    bash scripts/train/mdl/sft_full_streaming_7b_dmt_0-5.sh
    ```

## ‚ö° Inference

We provide two ways to run inference:

**1. Inference Script:**

Use the provided script for batch inference or more complex scenarios:

```bash
bash scripts/inference/infer.sh
```

**2. Jupyter Notebook Demo:**

For a simpler demonstration without the RIFREM module, you can use the Jupyter Notebook:

```
scripts/inference/qwen2_vl_mcot.ipynb
```
This notebook provides a straightforward example of how to load the model and generate output for a given input.
